# Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones

As an active GOT fan, I was aspired to accomplish the project on DataCamp: Network Analysis of Game of Throne. 


The project focuses on:

1. Create network relationshiop graph between the characters
 
2. Finding the most important character in book 1 and book 5 by using degree centrality method 
 
3. The evolution of most imporatnat character changes in book 1
 
4. The betweenness centrality and Google PageRank to find important characters in our Game of Thrones character co-occurrence network over the five books

5. The importance of characters in the Game of Thrones network according to Google PageRank
 
6. The correlation between pagerank, betweenness centrality, and degree centrality in fifth book

7. Who is/are the most important character(s) in the fifth book according to pagerank, betweenness centrality, and degree centrality measures?



Data Frame including:

Source / Target: two nodes that are linked by an edge 

Type: The weight attribute of every edge tells us the number of interactions that the characters have had over the book

Weight: The weight attribute 

Book: The book tells is which season we are on
